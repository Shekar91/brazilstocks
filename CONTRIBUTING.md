Thank you for your interest in contributing! We appreciate your help in making this project better. This guide outlines the process for making a successful contribution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
* **Git**
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Highly Recommended for a consistent environment)
* **Python 3.8+** and **Node.js 16+** (If you prefer not to use Docker)

### 2. Setup the Development Environment
We use **Docker** for local development to ensure environment consistency.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the 'Fork' button on the main repository page.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bratergit/brazilstocks.git](https://github.com/bratergit/brazilstocksstocks.git)

    ```
3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the necessary Python and Node.js service images and start the containers.
