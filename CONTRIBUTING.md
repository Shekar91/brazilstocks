Ensure you have the following installed:

* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (Highly Recommended for a consistent environment)
* **Python 3.8+** and **Node.js 16+** (If you prefer not to use Docker)

### 2. Setup the Development Environment
We use **Docker** for local development to ensure environment consistency.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the 'Fork' button on the main repository page.
